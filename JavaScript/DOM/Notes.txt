Q1.a) DOM manipulation:
    DOM manipulation refers to the process of using JavaScript to dynamically change the content, structure, and style 
    of a web page by accessing and modifying the Document Object Model (DOM).

    Examples of DOM manipulation include:
        - Show error message if the user submits a form without filling out required fields.

Example:
    let element = document.getElementById("myElementId");
    element.style.color = "red"; // Change the text color to red

   .)getElementsByClassName() - it is a method in DOM that is used to access all HTML elements that share a specific class name.
    Example:        
        let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClassName");
        for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
            elements[i].style.fontSize = "20px"; // Change the font size of each element to 20px
        }

            element.style.border = "1px solid black"; // Add a black border to each element
        });    

Q4) What is form validation :
    Form validation is the process of ensuring that the data entered into a web form meets certain criteria before it is submitted 
    to a server or processed further. This helps to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and in the correct format.

How to get user input in DOM:
    To get user input in DOM, you can use various methods to access the value of form elements such as input fields, textareas, 
    and select dropdowns. The most common way to get user input is by using the .value property of these elements.
